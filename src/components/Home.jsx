            <br />
            <p>
              deThread enables developers to easily establish an in-browser distributed computing network that is fault
              tolerant, secure, and compatible with any batch, iterative process.

            <br />
            <br />
            <p>Traditionally, distributed computing processes have been written with lower level
            languages such as C++ and Java. However, by using JavaScript, deThread enables the distribution
            of processes on any device with a web browser. In-browser distributed computing inherently has a
            low barrier to entry: users can contribute to a distributed process simply by accessing a URL.</p>
