              deThread can be installed directly from npm and required into server-side JavaScript.
              The library exposes several objects and methods to allow the developer to configure an
              application to run a distributed process and add additional event handlers to include
              logic for complex processes. Developers write the client-side code to run a process
              with inputs provided by the server, as well as define the task chunks controlled on the server.
              Once a process starts, deThread handles the distribution of tasks and the management of “joining”
              and “leaving” clients in the background automatically, using web sockets to provide bi-directional,
              real-time communication. Additionally, each client can run multiple tasks in parallel with web workers,
              which run non-blocking JavaScript threads outside the main browser context.
